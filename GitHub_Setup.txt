# Setting Up GitHub Secrets for Deployment

To securely deploy to your Digital Ocean droplet, you need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **DROPLET_IP**: Your Digital Ocean droplet IP address
   - Value: `165.22.231.145`

2. **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**: Your SSH private key for accessing the droplet
   - This is the private part of the SSH key you added to Digital Ocean

## How to Add These Secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click on "New repository secret"
5. Add each secret:
   - Name: `DROPLET_IP`
   - Value: `165.22.231.145`
   - Click "Add secret"

   Then repeat for SSH_PRIVATE_KEY:
   - Name: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Value: *[Your entire SSH private key content, including BEGIN and END lines]*
   - Click "Add secret"

## Important Security Notes:

- Never commit your SSH private key to your Git repository
- Make sure your private key has proper permissions (chmod 600)
- Consider using a deployment key specific for this purpose rather than your personal key
